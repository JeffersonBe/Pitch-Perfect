#Pitch Perfect

Perfect pitch is an application created during Udacity programme. You can record an audio and play it with 4 differents playback sound (slow, quick, Chimpmunk and Dark Vador like)

## What I learned from developing this application
* Using Interface Builder to add UI to view
* Connection UI to Code
* Famliarising with Apple iOS documentation (AVAudio)
* Understand MVC, Event, Delegate and Swift syntax

## Improvements
* Being able to save record onto devices
* Having more playback sound effects
* Playing with iOS layout

It's been developed using xCode 6.4, iOS8.4 and Swift 1.2 as required by Udacity.
